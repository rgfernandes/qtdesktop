 * This namespace contains functions for extracting low-level stuff like atoms,
 * integers or strings from a raw data that server sent us.
 *
 * All functions share a similar API -- first argument, a QByteArray instance,
 * holds *complete* line including trailing CRLF, second argument is offset
 * where the parsing should start. It's a non-const reference to int as it gets
 * changed after the requested item is read.
 *
 * All functions assume that all {size}-based literals are already prefetched,
 * ie. there's no interaction with the Imap::Parser's methods for retrieving
 * further data.
