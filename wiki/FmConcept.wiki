#summary Concept of FileManager/FileDialog.

= Problem =

  * QFileDialog (QFD) uses hardcoded QFileSystemModel (QFSM) (or native win/mac/kde/gnome FileDialog).
  * QFSM uses hardcoded local filesystem.
  * Then we can't use QFD for virtual filesystems (VFS').
  * And can't use QFSM for file manager - for VFS'.

= Solution =

  * Add own QAbstractFileHandlers (QAFH) for handling VFSs'.
  * Use own QFD successor
  * with own QAbstractItemModel (QAIM) or QFSM successor - QVFSModel.
  * as widget.
  * This widget is used by filemanager, archiver, ftp-client etc
  * but with addition respective menu

== ??? ==

  * Central widget - 1 or 2 list/table/icons (switchable) panels (2 panels are usual for copy/move operations).
  * Left side: tree, favorite, bookmarks - switchable on/off.
  * Topbar: actions for current panel: panel on/off (1 or 2 panels), view (list/table/icons), address.
  * below - custom topbar (for filemanager, archiver, ftp)
  * drug'n'drop
  * no tabs

== Inside ==

  * 1 model per panel
  * switch between QFSM/QVFSM.
  * fs watcher/locker.
  * connection manager (e.g. no more then 1 connection per 1 ftp host).

== Questions ==

  * how to switch between models
  * how to make connection manager
